# Brute-Force-Detection-Response
Elastic SIEM SOC Lab ‚Äì Brute Force Attack Detection &amp; Response using Windows Server,Pfsense, Kali, and Ubuntu
## Overview
This Project contains a **hands-on SOC lab** built using Elastic SIEM, Windows Server 2022, Kali Linux, Pfsense, and Ubuntu servers. It demonstrates **realistic attack scenarios**, detection rules, dashboards, and incident workflow documentation.

The lab covers:
- Networking Architecture (VM design, pfSense, segmentation)
- Brute-force attacks (SSH & RDP) (simulated adversary TTPs)
- Failed login analysis (Event ID 4625, Linux auth logs)
- Successful login analysis (Event ID 4624, Linux auth logs)
- Privilege escalation (simulated local admin / sudo abuse)
- Lateral movement (moving from one machine to another)
- Dashboards & detection rules (Elastic SIEM use cases)
- KQL Queries & Scripting (custom queries, automation scripts)
- PfSense Configuration (Incident Response & Containment)
  - Blocking malicious IPs
  - Isolating compromised hosts
- Patching (remediation on Windows/Linux clients)
  

This lab is designed to **showcase My SOC skills** Which including detection engineering, log correlation, incident analysis, and workflow documentation.

## Attack Simulations

### 1. SSH Brute Force
- **Command:** `hydra -l Administrator -P ./passlist.txt ssh://10.0.0.6`
- **Outcome:** Multiple failed SSH login attempts generated authentication logs and were detected in Elastic SIEM.

### 2. RDP Brute Force
- **Command:** `hydra -l Administrator -P ./passlist.txt rdp://10.0.0.6`
- **Observed Event IDs:** `4625 ‚Äì Failed logon (multiple failed RDP attempts)`
- **Outcome:** Elastic correlation rule flagged brute-force behavior. (Event ID 4625).

### 3. Successful SSH Login via Brute-Force
- **Command:** `hydra -l Administrator -P ./passlist.txt ssh://10.0.0.6`
- **Outcome:** Outcome: Password cyber!2025- found; login successful. Confirmed in Kibana.

### 4. Elastic Integrations Setup
- **Steps:** Installed and configured Elastic integrations to collect logs and telemetry from endpoints and servers..
- **Integrations Used:** Elastic Agent, Elastic Defend, Fleet Server, Prebuilt Security Detection Rules, Elastic Synthetics

### 5. Privilege Escalation
- **Steps:** A standard user account (testuser) was added to the Administrators group on the Windows Server, simulating privilege escalation by an attacker.
- Observed Event IDs:
  - 4624 ‚Äì Successful logon (tracking the session used for escalation)
  - 4672 ‚Äì Special privileges assigned to new logon (indicates elevated rights)
  - 4634 ‚Äì Logoff event (previous session closed before escalation attempt)
  - 4648 ‚Äì Logon with explicit credentials (often seen during escalation attempts)
  - 4728 ‚Äì A member was added to a security-enabled global group (if you added to ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù group)
  - 4720 ‚Äì New user account created (if you tested creating an account first)
- **Elastic Detection:** Correlation rules and dashboards in Elastic SIEM captured the privilege escalation by mapping the sequence of logon events, assignment of special privileges, and group membership changes, .

### 6. Lateral Movement
- **Steps:** Simulate remote PowerShell login to Windows target.
- **Elastic Detection:** Event IDs 4624 (logon), 4688 (process creation).

### 3. Threat Hunting ‚Äì  Elastic Detection 
- **Detection Logic:** Multiple failed SSH login attempts from the same source IP ('source.ip') within a short time frame.
   - **KQL Query:** `event.action: "logon-failed" AND winlog.event_id: 4625`
   - **Detection Rule:** Threshold ‚â• 5 failed SSH login attempts in 5 minutes from the same source IP.
   - **Outcome:** Identified suspicious brute force attempts against account root from attacker IP `10.0.0.7 (Kali Linux).`
   - Logs confirm repeated logon-failed actions on host WIN-DHNT661G6BP.
     - **SOC Use Case:** Helps analysts hunt brute force attempts that bypass normal authentication rules and confirm malicious login activity
